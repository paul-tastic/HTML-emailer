# HTML-emailer
The HTML emailer project is project I started when I realized I wanted to dip my toe into the world of html emails. Just to see if I could do it... I mean it didn't see too difficult of a concept. But then I realized I needed an interface and engine to provide
the means to execute the script, and send the email. So, this HTML-emailer project was born.

## Prerequisites
It's a one page app, no requires or dependencies (other than php's mail() function). If you choose to use it, you'll want to change the hard coded email address, and the bcc that goes to me. Also, your server will need to be capabale of running php.

## Contributions
I welcome any and all comments/suggestions on the code. Please, if you see something that could be improved or have a question, do not hesitate to mention it.
